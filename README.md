Evidence of tampered sysdiagnose (2025-09-20). The original file is only 7.75 MB (SHA256 A2A57847…), far smaller than normal sysdiagnose logs (hundreds of MB). A 7z archive was created for public verification (SHA256 21551F89…). Both hashes confirm integrity of this tampered proof.
On 2025-09-20 a sysdiagnose was forcibly generated from iPhone OS 22F76. Instead of the expected hundreds of MB, the output was only 7.75 MB (8123732 bytes). Its SHA256 hash is A2A57847A1792F7A839F862481AE3744404FAB4FDC3DAFFA8F833C7F125F2EB7. The file cannot be decompressed due to an invalid gzip block type, consistent with deliberate truncation or tamper. For distribution and public verification, the file was repackaged into a 7z container with no compression. That archive’s SHA256 hash is 21551F89DDCC05AE2EF952C26F2339381268C8C1B9549EFF0150E8CF646B15A0. Anyone may download, extract, and confirm that the internal tar.gz matches the original hash. This dual-hash record ensures reproducibility and prevents claims of user error. Screenshots and timestamps of creation (19:47:57 +07:00) and archive (19:59:30 +07:00) further support chain-of-custody. This repository preserves both CSV and PDF logs of the evidence for future audit.
